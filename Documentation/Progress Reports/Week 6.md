# PCB first tests and first live test

On Sunday I managed to solder all the components together, at the expense of a single PCB out of the five I ordered. Not too bad, for having been the first time I solder a component onto an actual PCB. After that I tested that the entire system worked, and to my surprise, it did first try, well almost. The reason why I used up an extra PCB was because I didn't properly solder the MCU onto the PCB, meaning that the connection was unstable. Apart from that, work on the case began. I was lucky enough to have exact dimensions for the PCB and all components and holes, so I could easily make a 3d model of the case. Around Thursday, I decided it would be a good idea to do a live test on Saturday, and hurried up to finish the case on time. Friday night I realized that I wasn't going to be able to finish printing the entire case before the live test, so I decided to remove the walls and just have a top and bottom plate to keep the PCB from touching the floor with bare connections. Luckily, this half case was able to be finished before the live test, and it was a success. The live test went without any errors or faults, which was releiving to see.
