# First feedback

This week was all about responding to feedback from the live test. I worked on updating the case and was able to finish the design for the full body case, and will be finished during week 8. I also worked on creating my own knobs for the potentiometers, and was able to make a test knob with the correct dimensions. All I need for the knobs now is to make them look pretty.
