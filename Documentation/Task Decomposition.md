- [ ] Design final product part 1
  - [ ] Choose components for the project
    - [x] ~~push buttons~~
    - [x] ~~potentiometers~~
    - [ ] capacitors (breadboard and SMD)
    - [ ] LED (SMD) ? 
  - [ ] Design PCB according to the size and pin specifications of all the components
    - [ ] Send schematics to be printed by a 3rd party PCB printing company online
  - [ ] Create rough sketch of the layout for the push buttons and potentiometers

        
- [ ] Prototype on final design components
  - [ ] Rewire breadboard to test final design push buttons, potentiometers, and capacitor
  - [ ] Solder final design push buttons, capacitors, potentiometers, and MCU to the 3rd party PCB
  - [ ] Test to make sure PCB and components are working as should


- [ ] Design final product part 2
  - [ ] Dimension the PCB and its will-be-visible components 
  - [ ] Create rough sketch of case
  - [ ] Print the case
    - [ ] First half is the top part with the holes for the push buttons, potentiometers, and Micro USB port
    - [ ] Bottom half is a solid plate
    - [ ] Halves are connected via screws
    - [ ] Reiterate until dimensions are good


- [ ] Assemble final design
  - [ ] Attach PCB inside the case
  - [ ] Close the case and attach external components
    - [ ] Friction pad to prevent sliding
    - [ ] Clear plastic to view led ?


- [ ] Final live test
  - [ ] Do final test to make sure all works well
  - [ ] Do a live test with entire setup at church
